# Statistical & Predictive Analysis of Lake Ice Cover Data

A Python-based project that compares algorithm performance and models historical
ice cover on Lake Mendota & Lake Monona.

It includes:

* Paired t-tests and 95% confidence intervals for algorithm F1-score comparison

* Bootstrapping procedures to generate robust performance intervals

* Time-series exploration and visualization of annual ice-on/off dates

* Linear regression modeling (train/test split, MSE evaluation) to quantify
  long-term trends

* Maximum likelihood estimation under a Laplace noise model for parameter
  inference

All analyses leverage Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, and scikit-learn, with clear
Jupyter notebooks and reproducible code.
