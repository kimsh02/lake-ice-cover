% \item[B.] Making a world coordinate system.
%   Below in Figure 4, I provide the world coordinate system for the image provided
%   for hw03.

%   \begin{figure}[H]
%     \centering \fbox{
%       \begin{minipage}{.98\linewidth}
%         \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{IMG_0862.jpeg}
%         \caption{World coordinate system for provided image for hw03. The X, Y,
%           and Z axes are clearly labeled, and the direction of the axes' arrows
%           indicate in which direction they grow. 15 blue points have been
%           selected for this experiement as shown, and their (X,Y,Z) coordinates
%           are labeled in yellow.}
%         \label{fig:b1}
%       \end{minipage}}
%   \end{figure}

%   These 15 blue world coordinate points in Figure 4 will be used for Part C to
%   compare how two cameras map these 3D world coordinates to 2D. The files
%   world\_coords.txt and image\_coords.txt have also been provided in this
%   submission for Part C. The world coordinates of the points are as they are in
%   Figure 4, and the image coordinates (X, Y) were obtained using the
%   `datacursormode on' feature in MATLAB and manually clicking on the labeled
%   blue points.

% \item[C.] Analyzing how a camera matrix maps points from 3D to 2D.

%   Below in Figure 5, I provide the visual representation of our clicked world
%   coordinates along with the two camera estimates of our world coordinates.

%   \begin{figure}[H]
%     \centering \fbox{
%       \begin{minipage}{.98\linewidth}
%         \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Screenshot 2024-09-29 at 11.19.16â€¯PM.png}
%         \caption{The red clicked points are our world coordinates from Figure 4
%           moved onto this black canvas to compare to our first (green) and
%           second (blue) camera estimates. Produced in MATLAB.}
%         \label{fig:c1}
%       \end{minipage}}
%   \end{figure}

%   In Figure 5 above, we can see that both the first and camera estimates are
%   visually close to our red clicked points. One thing to note when plotting the
%   estimates was to flip the X and Y coordinates generated from the given camera
%   matrices which we explored the reason for in Part A.

%   The RMSE of the distance between the camera estaimte point and the actual
%   clicked point was calculated for both cameras in MATLAB. Again, when
%   calculating the distsances between points, we have to flip the coordinates
%   generated from the camera matrices, or flip the image coordinates of the world
%   coordinates. The key thing is to be consistent with our coordinate system
%   (either work in X vs Y values or work with indices of a matrix). The RMSEs are
%   as follows:

%   $RMSE_{camera1}=23.9$

%   $RMSE_{camera2}=40.7$

%   The RMSE of the camera estimated points and actual world coordinate points is
%   also known as the re-projection error as stated in the homework. From the
%   reported RMSEs of the cameras, the first camera is better quantitatively
%   speaking, and from scrutinizing Figure 5, one can see that the first camera
%   (green) points are closer to the clicked (red) points than the second (blue)
%   camera points on average.

%   Thus, the first camera's matrix is more accurate.
